# Prediction of Novel Proteins for causing Cardiovascular Disease: Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis

## Abstract:
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is 
typically caused by the accumulation of fatty 
deposits inside the arteries, which causes the flow of 
blood to the heart to be severely reduced or 
blocked, eventually leading to a heart attack. 
According to the World Health Organization 
(WHO), 17.9 million people die each year from 
CVDs, accounting for an estimated 32% of all 
deaths worldwide. The In-Vivo and In-Vitro
approaches are costly and take a long time to 
achieve the desired result, whereas In-Silico
approach gives the result more quickly. In this 
study the In-Silico approaches like Evolutionary 
Analysis and Protein-Protein Interactions are used 
to provide new insights into cardiovascular disease 
and allow for the prediction of new Cardiovascular 
Disease-causing proteins. Here, Evolutionary 
analysis is initially used to identify the similarities 
at the cellular and molecular levels of CVD-causing 
proteins and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) is 
used to build a network that identifies existing 
associations and predicts new ones between human 
proteins. This study reveals that Receptor tyrosine protein kinase (RET), Neurotropic Receptor 
Tyrosine Kinase 2 (NTRK2), Butyrylcholinesterase 
(BChE) and Brain-derived neurotropic factor 
(BDNF) are the new proteins directly and indirectly 
associated with CVD.
